# Summary

Do you have a smaller printer bed? Tired of printing tiny gliders?  
This special version of my Stratos glider (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:97803)  prints in pieces on a 100mm bed and assembles easily with a little superglue.  

Be sure to read the readme file prior to printing...there are some important things to know when you slice the model.  

You may want a launcher ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:95765 )and a 8" x 1/8" rubber band to fully explore the flight envelope of this glider.  

If you like our models, keep us designing for you instead of flipping burgers...purchase one of our premium designs from http://threedsy.com!   there is a collection of 100mm printable gliders, including a special 100mm printable version of the stingray! (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:158430)  

If you want to learn how to design amazing, highly functional designs for 3d printing, design and print useful repair parts, and generally print useful stuff faster, more reliably, and with less problems [check out my books, Functional design for 3D printing and the Zombie Apocalypse Guide to 3D Printing on Amazon!](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=Clifford+T+Smyth&search-alias=books&field-author=Clifford+T+Smyth&sort=relevancerank)

Description: An efficient conventional glider, ideal for looping flights and long glides.  

Plastic: ABS  

Layers: .20mm  

Fill: 25%   

Perimeters: 2  

Solid Layers: 2  


Orientation:   
first layer lentghwise (0 degrees to fuselage), alternate by 90 degrees. A 45 degree (or non right angle) axis will cause asymetrical wing warping under load (bad).  

Build Notes:   
Allow to cool before carefully removing from build platform. The wings are easily deformed during removal, and must be absoultely symmetrical for proper flight. Removal with a very thin plastic spatula (print one!) is preferred. Test fit all parts and trim if necesary prior to final assembly with a very small amount of CA Glue.  

On a flat surface, carefully assemble fuselage from the halves, glue with CA glue, taking care that the fuselage is straight.  

After trimming, percisely tape wings together on bottom (bed side. Place taped wings bed side down on build table. Carefully fit fuselage into position on top of wings, trimming if necescary.holding in place, allow a very small amount of CA glue to infiltrate the space petween the wings and fuselage. after this initial glue dries, apply more until wings are securely attatched at the fuselage and at the spars.  

Glue the tail, hook, and canopy in place.  

The dihedral joint is assembled by clamping along the top of the fuselage between the wings to establish dihedral angle. Remove any adhesions, test clamp and adust as necescary to achieve a symmetrical dihedral angle prior to fixing in place with CA Glue.  

Check and adjust for symmetry.  

Adjust elevator as indicated below prior to flight.  


Flight Notes:   

Launching is by hand or with a 1/16" to 1/8" rubber band.   

Test and adjust by hand launching first.  

A slight elevator - up reflex is required for non-inverted flight. This is accomplished by latching the elevons up on the relex tabs on the aft end of the fuselage. A tiny drop of glue will prevent the elevons from moving from their latched position.   

A slight down bend in the latched-up elevators will open up the flight envelope to higher energy flights.  

A gradual test/adjust cycle is recommended. To correct turning or spiraling, differential elevator control (elevon) is preferred, though some aileron bending may be needed if the wings are warped from improper bed removal. Carefully bend this in with finger pressure, but avoid creasing or excessive strain.
